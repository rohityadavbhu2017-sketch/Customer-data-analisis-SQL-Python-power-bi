📊 Data Analytics Project
🧭 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow — from raw data to business insights.
It covers data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, dashboard creation in Power BI, and a final presentation report using Gamma.

The goal is to uncover insights from the dataset, visualize trends, and communicate findings effectively.

📁 Dataset

Source: (Specify your dataset source — e.g., Kaggle, internal data, etc.)

Format: CSV / Excel / SQL table

Description: The dataset includes (briefly describe what the data contains — e.g., sales transactions, customer details, etc.)

Size: (Number of rows and columns)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory analysis
PostgreSQL / SQL Server	Running SQL queries and aggregations
Power BI	Interactive data visualization dashboard
Gamma.app	Final presentation / storytelling slide deck
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code	Development environment
🚀 Steps in the Project
1. Data Loading

Imported dataset using Python (Pandas).

Checked data types, missing values, and structure.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed descriptive statistics and distribution analysis.

Visualized patterns and outliers using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Identified key variables influencing the target metrics.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing and duplicate values.

Standardized column names and formats.

Converted data types where necessary.

4. SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / SQL Server.

Wrote SQL queries to extract and aggregate data.

Created views and joins for deeper insights.

5. Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Imported final SQL output / CSV into Power BI.

Built interactive dashboards showing KPIs, trends, and comparisons.

Added slicers, filters, and drill-through features.

6. Reporting & Presentation

Summarized key findings and insights.

Created a visual report and presentation using Gamma.

Focused on business outcomes and recommendations.

📈 Dashboard Highlights

Interactive visuals with filters for key variables.

KPI cards summarizing important metrics.

Trend analysis charts for time-based insights.

User-friendly and business-focused design.

(Add a screenshot or link to your Power BI dashboard if available.)

🧩 Results & Insights

Key trends and actionable insights discovered.

Recommendations for decision-making or strategy improvement.

Quantitative improvements or performance metrics (if applicable).
